## Description

The chat application will leverage the power of Jetpack Compose, a modern toolkit for building native Android UI. Jetpack Compose simplifies UI development by offering a declarative approach, powerful tools, and Kotlin APIs. With this project, we aim to demonstrate how to integrate Jetpack Compose into a real-world application and showcase its capabilities for creating engaging chat interfaces.
